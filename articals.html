        title: "The Majestic Dance of Binary Stars: Celestial Partnerships",
        content: "<p>Article 2: The Majestic Dance of Binary Stars</p><p>Binary stars, consisting of two stars orbiting a common center of mass, showcase the beauty of celestial partnerships. These stellar duos come in various forms, from closely orbiting pairs that appear as a single point of light to widely separated systems with distinct individual stars. Observing binary stars allows astronomers to investigate stellar evolution, measure stellar masses, and gain insights into the dynamics of star systems.</p>"
